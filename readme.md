# How to

- run `npm install` in terminal
- add your data to the input.csv (or delete it and paste your own file there (but call it the same `input.csv` filename))
- toward the very end of line 16 in the index.js file, you'll want to change that `.something` to whatever the name of your column is in the csv
- run `node index` in terminal 
- should see an updated output.svg with the lines.
- If you have multiple columns, I think the best way would be to just copy over all your new lines in illustrator to another illustrator file, change that `.something` to your next column, then run it again which will create a new output.svg file with the new column.

- NOTE: if you want to see it in action with this filler data, delete the output.svg and run the script, it should create a new one.
